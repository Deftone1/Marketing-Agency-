Code refactoring/SEO optimization for a marketing agency webpage

First homework assignment was to refactor the code for this marketing agency's website to make it more legible, clearly written, 
and help optimize search engine optimization.  
I edited a few missing semantic elements on the HTML page as well as added some other tags for images. 

CSS had multiple redundant selectors, so many of those were consolidated to decrease the amount of readable code.
